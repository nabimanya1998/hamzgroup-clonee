										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>KAMPALA, Oct. 12 (Reuters)</strong> — The sun rose over Kololo Ceremonial Grounds as Kampala’s heartbeat pulsed anew, marked by music, dance, and enterprise. The city’s biggest annual celebration, the Kampala City Festival 2025, returned with renewed vigor, thanks to the generosity of philanthropist and real estate magnate <strong>Dr. Hamis Kiggundu</strong>, CEO of <strong>Ham Group of Companies</strong>.</p>



<p>Two weeks before the event, Dr. Kiggundu pledged <strong>UGX 200 million</strong> toward the festival, making his firm the largest private sponsor and reigniting enthusiasm for a celebration that symbolizes Kampala’s resilience and collective pride.</p>



<p>By midmorning, the city’s streets had transformed into a vibrant procession of color and rhythm. More than 4,000 Ham Group representatives, clad in festival-branded attire, paraded from Buganda Road to Kololo, accompanied by ten entertainment trucks promoting the company’s subsidiaries—from real estate and finance to philanthropy and technology. The spectacle, personally flagged off by Dr. Kiggundu, amplified this year’s theme, <em>“Culture, Innovation, and Sustainability.”</em></p>



<p>Organized by the <strong>Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA)</strong>, the 2025 festival marked a triumphant revival after a long hiatus. Kololo buzzed with excitement as artisans displayed crafts, food vendors served local favorites, and children played in the new “Children’s Village,” a vibrant zone filled with games and art activities.</p>



<p>KCCA Executive Director <strong>Hajjat Sharifah Buzeki</strong> and State Minister for Kampala <strong>Hon. Kabuye Kyofatogabye</strong> lauded the collaboration between private sponsors and city authorities. “This event shows what can happen when creativity and community align,” Buzeki remarked during a site inspection.</p>



<p>As dusk fell, the main stage came alive with performances by top Ugandan artists including <strong>Ava Peace</strong>, <strong>Pastor Wilson Bugembe</strong>, <strong>Minister Rachael Kay</strong>, and the <strong>Watoto Children’s Choir</strong>. Prime Minister <strong>Rt. Hon. Robinah Nabbanja</strong>, attending as Guest of Honour, commended KCCA and its partners for organizing a festival that “captures Kampala’s spirit of inclusivity and joy.”</p>



<p>Throughout the day, <strong>Ham Group’s strong presence</strong>—from volunteer teams to event branding—was unmistakable. Social media feeds buzzed with posts tagged <strong>#HamAtKCF2025</strong>, highlighting the company’s participation and national pride under the slogan <em>“For God and My Country.”</em></p>



<p>For Dr. Kiggundu, the festival was more than a sponsorship. It reflected his belief in <strong>public-private collaboration</strong> as a catalyst for Uganda’s growth. “Every thriving city has a private sector that drives innovation,” he said. “Our partnership with KCCA demonstrates that nation-building is a shared responsibility.”</p>



<p>As fireworks lit the Kampala sky, the festival concluded with a sense of unity and optimism. Citizens celebrated not only their culture but also the partnership between business and community that made it shine.</p>



<p>Kampala rejoiced. Ham Group inspired. And Dr. Hamis Kiggundu reminded the city that true progress is built when enterprise and society move together.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ham Rallies the Business Community</h3>



<p>Taking the podium, Dr. Kiggundu made it clear that his contribution is more than just money — it’s a call to action.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“We live in this city, we work here, we employ many people here, and we own properties here. So when an opportunity like this comes to enhance the activities of the city, it is not only my pleasure but should be the pleasure of every businessperson to support. I call upon my fellow businessmen to follow suit,”</em> he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>His words resonated as a challenge to the private sector to step up and own Kampala’s biggest cultural street party.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Organizers Applaud Rare Gesture</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1200" height="960" src="https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-1200x960.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-361" srcset="https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-1200x960.jpg 1200w, https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-500x400.jpg 500w, https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-300x240.jpg 300w, https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-768x614.jpg 768w, https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-2048x1638.jpg 2048w, https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-94x75.jpg 94w, https://hamzgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1000932100-480x384.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width:767px) 480px, (max-width:1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>Festival Executive Director <strong>Sharifah Buzeki</strong> couldn’t hide her excitement as she applauded the landmark sponsorship.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“On behalf of the festival, I express our sincere gratitude to Ham Enterprises led by Dr. Ham Kiggundu. This UGX 200 million sponsorship is no small feat. It shows the true spirit of giving back to the very communities that support your businesses. Not many people can part with such an amount just to put smiles on the faces of others,”</em> she remarked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She described Ham’s support as a <strong>rare gesture of generosity</strong> that sets the bar for other business leaders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why It Matters</h3>



<p>The Kampala City Festival has become more than just entertainment — it’s a <strong>symbol of unity, culture, and resilience</strong> for millions of Ugandans. With Ham’s contribution, organizers promise an even bigger showcase of music, art, food, and business exhibitions.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“We look forward to seeing Ham and his entire team at the festival. This partnership proves that when businesses give back, everyone wins,”</em> Buzeki added.</p>

</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Bigger Picture</h3>



<p>Dr. Kiggundu has built a reputation for <strong>matching business success with community impact</strong>. From education to health to infrastructure, his philanthropic footprint is unmistakable. With this latest contribution, he has once again <strong>cemented his place as not only a businessman but also a people’s champion.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Ham Group of Companies</strong> is a Ugandan-based, privately owned multinational industrial conglomerate founded by <strong>Dr. Hamis Kiggundu</strong>.

Its official headquarters, famously known as <strong>The White House</strong>, is located in Uganda and serves as the nerve center of its operations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">History and Growth of the Ham Group</h3>



<p>The Ham Group’s journey began in 2005 when Dr. Kiggundu, leveraging his early experience assisting his father, <strong>Hajji Segawa</strong>, in his textile shop, ventured into <strong>garment trading</strong>. Starting small during school holidays, he used capital from his father to establish his initial business. This foundation provided him with vital entrepreneurial skills, which he later applied to <strong>real estate</strong> and property development.</p>



<p>In 2009, Dr. Kiggundu established <strong>Ham Enterprises (U) Ltd</strong>, marking the group’s formal entry into commercial property development. His first major real estate project, <strong>Ham Towers</strong>, was completed in 2010 in Kampala, followed by <strong>Ham Shopping Mall</strong> within 18 months. These projects generated significant rental income and provided credibility to secure <strong>bank financing</strong>, enabling further expansion.</p>



<p>By 2021, the Ham Group had diversified into large-scale <strong>industrialization</strong>, particularly in <strong>agro-processing</strong>, aiming to add value to Uganda’s agricultural products. A flagship initiative is the <strong>US$156 million Integrated Agro-Processing Industrial Plant (IAIP)</strong> at Akright City, a state-of-the-art facility supporting Uganda’s agricultural sector and boosting economic development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a remarkable act of generosity and vision, Dr. Hamis Kiggundu, a distinguished Ugandan author, entrepreneur, and advocate for African empowerment, recently visited Namibia with a mission to uplift the nation’s youth. Committed to fostering a brighter future for Africa, Dr. Kiggundu donated 10,000 copies of his influential books, Success and Failure Based on Reason and Reality and Reason as the World Masterpiece, to students and young leaders across Namibia. His goal? To spark a mindset shift that encourages critical thinking, purpose-driven action, and a pathway to prosperity.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>A Gift of Knowledge and Transformation</p>



<p>Dr. Kiggundu&#8217;s donation represents more than a collection of books; it’s an investment in the minds of the next generation. Through his writing, he calls on young Africans to unlock the potential within themselves, harness the power of reason, and use available resources wisely. His books touch on subjects that resonate deeply with Africa’s youth, tackling the continent’s unique challenges and laying out a roadmap to personal and communal growth built on self-reliance and logical thinking.</p>



<p>Reason as the World Masterpiece: A Blueprint for Africa’s Success</p>



<p>In Reason as the World Masterpiece, Dr. Kiggundu delves into the role of reasoning in achieving prosperity. He emphasizes that rational decision-making and purposeful action are key to overcoming Africa’s longstanding challenges. This book explores why Africa, despite its abundant resources, has yet to achieve its full potential. Dr. Kiggundu highlights that the missing link is the application of reason—an approach that Western nations have embraced to achieve progress. His message is clear and powerful: Africa’s journey from poverty to prosperity requires a focus on reasoned, purposeful actions.</p>
